# Algo Traders Wiki

Shared knowledge distilled from trading experiments; concrete results remain with their owning project.

> **Now:** `mean-variance-paper` has independent forward accumulation running (`analysis/forward_accumulate.py`, no longer depends on Ethan's broken Vercel monitor) — first real result (148 days, real 8-coin Hyperliquid book, TON found delisted and excluded) shows signed MV dominating equal-weight on Sharpe/Calmar/return but triggering decision-012's Kill If rule on max drawdown. Not treated as settled: the MDD gap needs a bootstrap CI (`evaluation-framework`'s existing `bootstrap.py`) before trusting a point estimate at N=148, below the project's own DSR-binding floor.
> **Queue:** Bootstrap the MDD CI; relay the TON delisting to Ethan; keep running `forward_accumulate.py` daily to genuinely accumulate observations toward N=250. Separately: `aurora-forecaster/` now has a working forecast-scoring module (2026-08-07) — first real result on 4 BTC origins found badly overconfident calibration (nominal 50/80/95% coverage only ~20/28/38% empirical), still needs its four text sources aligned into one input for the unimodal-vs-multimodal comparison. Also check for the literature-search workflow's first-ever PR (`gh run 31125217798`, triggered 2026-08-06).
