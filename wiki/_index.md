# Algo Traders Wiki

Shared knowledge distilled from trading experiments; concrete results remain with their owning project.

> **Archive:** Aurora's stream-ablation harness ran at n=12 origins (2026-08-09, 8/10 `STANDARD_CONFIGS`): the n=4 `funding-vision` result did not replicate, and no config significantly beat `unimodal`. The experiment and artifacts are retained in [`archive/aurora-forecaster/`](../archive/aurora-forecaster/). The calibration question remains open in [`open-threads.md`](open-threads.md).
> **Now:** `mean-variance-paper`'s forward accumulation is automated and running daily; latest recorded sample is N=216 on 2026-10-14, with the DSR checkpoint at N=250. The bootstrap CI on the signed-MV drawdown gap and relaying the TON delisting to Ethan remain open.
> **Queue:** `GDELT_ONLY`/`GDELT_CURRENTS` were rate-limited during the archived Aurora experiment; retry only if that work resumes.
